## How to Use

Import the project into an IDE of your choice. Run and build the project with the ModernProject.java file. A graphical user interface of the application should appear. Before using its features, the user should sign in or log in. The interface is user-friendly, so it would not be hard to understand how to create tasks, events, or journal logs.
